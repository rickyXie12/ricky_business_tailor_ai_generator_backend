## Architecture Decisions
- Used async/await with semaphore for concurrent processing
- Implemented rate limiting to respect OpenAI API limits
- PostgreSQL with proper indexing for performance
- Next.js with TypeScript for type safety

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   An OpenAI API key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ricky_business_tailor_ai_generator_backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Assuming a `requirements.txt` file exists in your project)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key. The application will need this to communicate with OpenAI services.
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the development server, use Uvicorn (a lightning-fast ASGI server):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
