## Batch Generation Results

The system successfully meets and exceeds all performance targets.

| Posts | Time          | Success Rate | Rate (posts/min) | Notes                   |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 10    | 40 seconds    | 100%         | ~15              | ✅ Meets < 90s target   |
| 50    | 3.10 minutes  | 100%         | ~16.1            | ✅ Meets < 5m target    |
| 100   | 6.30 minutes  | 100%         | ~15.9            | ✅ Meets < 10m target   |

## Optimization Strategies

1.  **Concurrent Processing**: The backend uses Python's `asyncio` library along with `asyncio.Semaphore` to process multiple post generations concurrently. This significantly speeds up the batch processing while respecting the rate limits of the OpenAI API.

2.  **Database Connection Management**: The initial `QueuePool limit of size 5 overflow 10 reached` error was resolved by ensuring proper database session management. Each asynchronous task now correctly handles its database session, preventing connection leaks and ensuring connections are returned to the pool promptly. This was achieved by using FastAPI's dependency injection system (`Depends(get_db)`) which handles the session lifecycle within each request/task.

3.  **Database Indexing**: The provided PostgreSQL schema includes performance indexes on critical foreign keys (`campaigns.user_id`, `campaign_posts.batch_job_id`) and status columns (`batch_jobs.status`). This ensures that queries to update and track job progress remain fast even with a large number of posts.

4.  **Robust Error Handling**: Each post generation is wrapped in a `try...except` block. If a single post fails (due to an OpenAI API error or other issue), it is logged as a failure, and the batch job continues with the remaining posts. This ensures that one bad apple doesn't spoil the whole batch.

## AI Tools Used

-   **GitHub Copilot && Gemini**: Heavily used for autocompleting boilerplate code, including Pydantic models, SQLAlchemy table definitions, and basic FastAPI route structures.
-   **Large Language Models (copilot/Gemini)**: Utilized for:
    -   Brainstorming architectural approaches for the batch processing engine.
    -   Debugging complex asynchronous code and database connection issues.
    -   Generating and refining the prompts sent to the OpenAI API for better quality captions and images.
    -   Assisting with frontend component creation in Next.js and TypeScript.

All AI-generated code was carefully reviewed, understood, and modified to meet the specific requirements and quality standards of the project.
